# Convolutional Neural Network is a Deep Learning algorithm specially designed
# for working with Images and videos. It takes images as inputs, extracts and
# learns the features of the image, and classifies them based on the learned features.

# CNN has various filters, and each filter extracts some information from the image such as
# edges, different kinds of shapes (vertical, horizontal, round), and then all of these
# are combined to identify the image.

# The CNN model works in two steps: feature extraction and Classification

# Feature Extraction is a phase where various filters and layers are applied to the images
# to extract the information and features out of it and once itâ€™s done it is passed on
# to the next phase i.e Classification where they are classified based on the target variable of the problem.
